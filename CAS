Comparison of open source computer algebra systems

Axiom
  doesn't use readline
  builtin hyperdoc is way behind HTML
  couldn't figure how to parse:
    integrand := x*((x^2*exp(2*x^2)-log(x+1)^2)^2) / ((x+1)*(log(x+1)^2 - x^2*exp(2*x^2))^2)


Maxima
  uses LISP-style function definition syntax

  MAXIMA function tex_displ(MLABEL %O14 EXPR)
    - fetch tex-environment - either "" (strings) OR tex-environment property on car OR *tex-environment-default*
    - print tex1(LABEL %O14) (minus 14 chars because of trailing \mathbb{false})
    - then print env around tex1(EXPR)

  MAXIMA function print(EXPR) calls displa for output


Sage
  struggling to do polynomial long division
    calls Maxima or Singular to do this
  implements algebraic closure of Q (QQbar)

  + fix latex printing on power series
  - subs should raise NotImplementedError if element not callable
  - subs should work recursively on complicated rings
  - option to specify how QQbar elements print
  - can't type convert between two slightly different NumberRings:
      Number Field in a with defining polynomial a^7 - 18
      Number Field in a with defining polynomial y^7 - 18
  - add map_coefficients method to Laurent series (Taylor, too?)


Macaulay 2
  doesn't implemente fraction fields over complicated (non-Z, non-Q) constant fields

Singular
  can't compute Riemann-Roch spaces in characteristic p
  can compute Hamber-Noether expansions (can this be converted to a Puiseux expansion?)

CoCoA
  C++ library


Macaulay 2 - Riemann-Roch space calculator (Noether-Brill algorithm ??)

HOW TO CREATE A MAP BETWEEN TWO POLYNOMIAL RINGS INDUCED BY A MAP ON THEIR COEFFICIENTS

R.<a> = QQ[]
aRing = NumberField(a^2 + 1, 'a')
R.<b> = QQ[]
bRing = NumberField(b^2 + 1, 'a')

aRing2 = aRing['x']
bRing2 = bRing['x']

h = aRing.hom(bRing.gens())

h2 = aRing2.hom(h, bRing2)

DOESN'T WORK FOR LAURENT SERIES



BUG REPORT TO SHOW HOW SINGULAR RETURNS RESULTS IN WRONG FIELD

R.<b> = QQ[]
S = NumberField(b^7 - 18, 'a')

R.<x,y> = S[]
f = x + y

singular.lib('hnoether.lib')
hne = f._singular_().hnexpansion().sage()

hne[0][0].base_ring() is f.parent()



SAGE - SINGULAR IDEALS

rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py
  lines 558-592
  create Singular ideal
  lift generators into parent ring before str-ifying them for Singular

interfaces/singular.py
  lines 1957-1959
  converts Singular ideal to sage ideal

   1958             R = R or self.sage_global_ring()
   1959             return R.ideal([p.sage_poly(R) for p in self])

  if R is a quotient ring,
    p.sage_poly(R) can't be lifted into the base ring

  sage_poly:

   1779             p = MPolynomial_polydict(R,PolyDict(sage_repr,force_int_exponents=False,force_etuples=False))
   1780             if isinstance(R, MPolynomialRing_polydict):
   1781                 return p
   1782             else:
   1783                 return QuotientRingElement(R,p,reduce=False)

  what we get back is a QuotientRingElement containing an MPolynomial_polydict

  self.sage_global_ring() will return a quotient ring different from the one we started with
    its generators will be named 'x', 'y', 'z', instead of 'xbar', 'ybar', 'zbar'

  subs doesn't work because _call_ isn't defined on QuotientRingElement's
    (subs in RingElement returns self if _call_ isn't defined)

RIEMANN-ROCH BASIS

Singular: three methods
  brnoeth.lib (D.10.1) - ground field must be finite
     call NSplaces to get a list of non-singular places
     pass in a intvec to specify the order of the divisor at each place
  brillnoether.lib (D.15.2) - ground field must be Q
  hess.lib (D.15.19) - ground field must be Q
     pass in two fractional ideals - one for finite places, one for infinite places

Macaulay 2
  completeLinearSystemOnNodalPlaneCurve
     I guess this only works on a nodal curve?
     input specified as a pair of ideals of coordinate ring (Weil divisor)
