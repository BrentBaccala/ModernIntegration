\example Compute $\int \sin x \, {\rm d}x$

We'll operate in ${\mathbb C}(x, \phi = \exp \,ix)$ and evaluate

$$\int \frac{\phi - \phi^{-1}}{2i} \,dx$$

The first step is to normalize the integrand, first by transforming it
into a rational function:

$$\int \frac{\phi^2 - 1}{2i \phi} \,dx $$

and next by using polynomial division to split it into a polynomial
and a proper fraction with a monic denominator:

$$\int \left[ \frac{1}{2i} \phi - \frac{1}{2i} \frac{1}{\phi} \right] \,dx $$

The integral must have the form $a_1 \phi + a_{-1} \frac{1}{\phi}$
with $a_1, a_{-1} \in {\mathbb C}(x)$ and must satisfy the equations:

$$\frac{1}{2i} = a_1' + i a_1 \qquad - \frac{1}{2i} = a_{-1}' - i a_{-1}$$ 

These are very simple Risch equations that can be solved by inspection
to obtain $a_1 = a_{-1} = -\frac{1}{2}$, so

$$\int \frac{\phi - \phi^{-1}}{2i} \,dx = -\frac{1}{2}(\phi + \phi^{-1})
 = -\frac{1}{2}(e^{ix} + e^{-ix}) = -\cos x$$

\example Compute $\int \csc x \, {\rm d}x$

We'll operate in ${\bf C}(x, \phi = \exp \,ix)$ and evaluate

$$\int {{2i}\over{\phi - \phi^{-1}}} \,dx = \int 2i {{\phi}\over{\phi^2 - 1}} \,dx$$

Now we want a partial fractions expansion.  We could use a resultant,
or the Euclidean G.C.D. algorithm, but it's simpler to just note that
the denominator's a difference of squares and compute:

$${{c_1}\over{\phi-1}} + {{c_2}\over{\phi+1}} = {{\phi}\over{\phi^2-1}} $$

$${{c_1}(\phi+1)} + {{c_2}(\phi-1)} = \phi \qquad c_1 = c_2 = {1\over2} $$

giving us

$$\int i \big[ {{1}\over{\phi-1}} + {{1}\over{\phi+1}} \big] dx$$

Now, we have irreducible, square-free, non-monic denominators, so the
answer (if it exists) must be expressed in terms of their logarithms:

$$ d \ln(\phi+1) = {{d(\phi+1)}\over{\phi+1}} = {{i\phi\,dx}\over{\phi+1}} = [1 - {{1}\over{\phi+1}}]i\,dx$$

$$ d \ln(\phi-1) = {{d(\phi-1)}\over{\phi-1}} = {{i\phi\,dx}\over{\phi-1}} = [1 + {{1}\over{\phi-1}}]i\,dx$$

so the integral can be written:

$$\int {{d(\phi-1)}\over{\phi-1}} - {{d(\phi+1)}\over{\phi+1}} = \ln (\phi-1) - \ln(\phi+1) = \ln({{\phi-1}\over{\phi+1}})$$
$$ = \ln ({{e^{ix}-1}\over{e^{ix}+1}}) = \ln ({{e^{ix/2}-e^{-ix/2}}\over{e^{ix/2}+e^{-ix/2}}}) = \ln i {{\sin {x\over2}}\over{\cos {x\over2}}} = \ln \tan {x\over2} $$

where I dropped the $i$ at the end because, as a constant multiple
inside a logarithm, it disappears into the constant of integration,
and we conclude that

$$\int \csc x \,{\rm d}x = \ln \tan {x\over2} $$
