# ModernIntegration
An undergraduate differential algebra textbook

Currently, the first six chapters, covering the transcendental cases, are in fairly good order,
but are not yet suitable for publication.

Chapter 1 is an introduction.

Chapter 2 is a review of basic commutative algebra.

Chapter 3 introduces differential algebra, gives a precise definition of
the term "elementary function", shows how symbolic integration can be
reduced to three basic cases, and finally states and proves Liouville's theorem.

Chapter 4 covers integration of rational functions, a topic mostly addressed in elementary
calculus classes, but the focus here is on an outlying case, generally skipped, that
can lead to discontinuous integrals even when the integrand is continuous.

Chapter 5 covers the logarithmic extension.

Chapter 6 covers the exponential extension.

Chapter 7, which begins the discussion of Abelian integrals, is somewhat readable but quite incomplete.

Chapter 8, covering Good Reduction, which is the most technically challenging part of the theory,
is only a sketch.

Chapter 9, covering algebraic extensions in general, is also only a sketch.
