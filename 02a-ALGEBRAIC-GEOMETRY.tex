In pure algebra, such as we've studied in the last chapter, $x$ is just $x$.  It does not
``take a value'' and has no other interpretation.  Everything we did in the last chapter
is based solely on the axioms of a commutative ring or field.

We next want to consider what happens when we let $x$ take a value, say a real number,
and then conclude that the equation $x^2-1=0$ is true if $x$ is either $-1$ or $1$.

This is now {\it algebraic geometry}.

\mysection{Solving systems of equations}

Probably the most basic application of primary decomposition is solving systems of equations.

An ideal in a polynomial ring has an associated {\it variety}, which is the set of points that
zero all of the polynomials in the ideal.  A variety can be expressed as the intersection of
its irreducible components, each of which corresponds precisely with a primary ideal in
the primary decomposition.

If the underlying field of constants has no zero divisors (as is the case with ordinary real
or complex numbers), then we are justified in taking the radical of the ideal, and then
the primary decomposition is just the prime decomposition because our primary ideals
are all prime ideals.

Returning to the $(xy,xz)$ example, we found that this ideal's primary decomposition
is $(x) \cap (y,z)$.  In other words, the solution variety of the system
of equations $xy=0$, $xz=0$ is formed by the $z$-axis $y=0$ $z=0$ and the $x-y$ plane $x=0$.
